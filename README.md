# TradingView MCP Kyntara Dynamics

This repo is from Jackson on YouTube. This is the improved fork. Everything you need is below.

Built on top of the original [tradingview-mcp](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp) by [@tradesdontlie](https://github.com/tradesdontlie). Full credit to them for the foundation. This fork adds a morning brief workflow, a rules config, and fixes the launch bug on TradingView Desktop v2.14+.

> [!WARNING]
> **Not affiliated with TradingView Inc. or Anthropic.** This tool connects to your locally running TradingView Desktop app via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Review the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) before use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Requires a valid TradingView subscription.** This tool does not bypass any TradingView paywall. It reads from and controls the TradingView Desktop app already running on your machine.

> [!NOTE]
> **All data processing happens locally.** Nothing is sent anywhere. No TradingView data leaves your machine.

## What's New in This Fork

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `morning_brief` | One command that scans your watchlist, reads all your indicators, and returns structured data for Claude to generate your session bias |
| `session_save` / `session_get` | Saves your daily brief to `~/.tradingview-mcp/sessions/` so you can compare today vs yesterday |
| `rules.json` | Write your trading rules once — bias criteria, risk rules, watchlist. The morning brief applies them automatically every day |
| Launch bug fix | Fixed `tv_launch` compatibility with TradingView Desktop v2.14+ |
| `tv brief` CLI | Run your morning brief from the terminal in one word |

---

## One-Shot Setup

Paste this into Claude Code and it will handle everything:

```Text
Goal:
Install and configure `tradingview-mcp-kd` for VS Code using the `DevAgentsHome` environment variable as the install root.

Repository:
https://github.com/Kyntara-Dynamics/tradingview-mcp-kd.git

Install location:
$env:DevAgentsHome\tradingview-mcp-kd

Requirements:
- Use PowerShell-compatible commands.
- Do not overwrite existing configuration or files unless explicitly instructed.
- Preserve any existing MCP servers and settings.
- Create timestamped backups before modifying configuration files.
- Validate JSON before saving configuration changes.
- Clearly report any missing prerequisites or failed commands.

Steps:
1. Verify that the following commands are available in PowerShell:
   - git
   - node
   - npm
   - code

2. Verify that the environment variable `DevAgentsHome` exists:
   - Read it from `$env:DevAgentsHome`.
   - Resolve it to an absolute path.
   - Confirm that the directory exists.
   - Stop and report an error if it is missing or invalid.

3. Clone the repository:
   - Target path: `$env:DevAgentsHome\tradingview-mcp-kd`
   - If the target directory already exists and contains a Git repository, run `git pull`.
   - If the target directory exists but is not a Git repository, stop and report the conflict.
   - Otherwise, clone the repository into the target path.

4. Install dependencies:
   - Change directory to `$env:DevAgentsHome\tradingview-mcp-kd`.
   - Run `npm install`.

5. Locate the VS Code MCP configuration file:
   - Check the standard VS Code user settings and MCP configuration locations for Windows.
   - Prefer the configuration location used by the currently installed VS Code MCP support.
   - If no MCP configuration exists, create one using valid JSON.
   - Preserve all existing configuration content.

6. Merge the following MCP server entry into the existing MCP configuration:


{
  "mcpServers": {
    "traderview": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "<RESOLVED_DEV_AGENTS_HOME>\\tradingview-mcp-kd\\src\\server.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}


Replace `<RESOLVED_DEV_AGENTS_HOME>` with the resolved absolute value of `$env:DevAgentsHome`.

Important merge rules:

* Do not remove existing MCP servers.
* Do not overwrite unrelated settings.
* If a `traderview` server already exists, update only that server entry after creating a backup.
* Ensure the final file is valid JSON.

7. Back up the MCP configuration file before saving:

   * Use a timestamped filename such as:
     `mcp-config.backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json`

8. Copy rules file:

   * Source: `$env:DevAgentsHome\tradingview-mcp-kd\rules.example.json`
   * Destination: `$env:DevAgentsHome\tradingview-mcp-kd\rules.json`
   * If `rules.json` already exists, leave it unchanged and report that it was preserved.
   * If `rules.example.json` does not exist, report that clearly and continue without creating `rules.json`.

9. Open `rules.json` in VS Code if it exists:

   * Run:
     `code "$env:DevAgentsHome\tradingview-mcp-kd\rules.json"`

10. Reload VS Code:

* Tell me to run “Developer: Reload Window” from the VS Code Command Palette, or perform the equivalent if available.

11. Verify the setup:

* Attempt to run or invoke the MCP health-check tool exposed by the configured server if possible.
* If a tool named `tv_health_check` exists, use it.
* If it cannot be invoked directly from the terminal, explain exactly how to verify it from VS Code’s MCP tools interface.

Deliverables:

* Show the final resolved install path.
* Show which MCP configuration file was modified.
* Confirm whether dependencies installed successfully.
* Confirm whether `rules.json` was created, preserved, or unavailable because `rules.example.json` was missing.
* Confirm whether the `traderview` MCP server entry was added or updated.
* Include any errors encountered and the exact next step needed to fix them.
```

Or follow the manual steps below.

## Prerequisites

- **TradingView Desktop app** (paid subscription required for real-time data)
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Claude Code** (for MCP tools) or any terminal (for CLI)
- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LewisWJackson/tradingview-mcp-jackson.git ~/tradingview-mcp-jackson
cd ~/tradingview-mcp-jackson
npm install
```

### 2. Set up your rules

```bash
cp rules.example.json rules.json
```

Open `rules.json` and fill in:
- Your **watchlist** (symbols to scan each morning)
- Your **bias criteria** (what makes something bullish/bearish/neutral for you)
- Your **risk rules** (the rules you want Claude to check before every session)

### 3. Launch TradingView with CDP

TradingView must be running with the debug port enabled.

**Mac:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_mac.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
scripts\launch_tv_debug.bat
```

**Linux:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_linux.sh
```

Or use the MCP tool after setup: `"Use tv_launch to start TradingView in debug mode"`

### 4. Add to Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/.mcp.json` (merge with any existing servers):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tradingview": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/tradingview-mcp-jackson/src/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username. On Mac: `echo $USER` to check.

### 5. Verify

Restart Claude Code, then ask: *"Use tv_health_check to verify TradingView is connected"*

### 6. Run your first morning brief

Ask Claude: *"Run morning_brief and give me my session bias"*

Or from the terminal:
```bash
npm link  # install tv CLI globally (one time)
tv brief
```

---

## Morning Brief Workflow

This is the feature that turns this from a toolkit into a daily habit.

**Before every session:**

1. TradingView is open (launched with debug port)
2. Run: `tv brief` in your terminal (or ask Claude: *"run morning_brief"*)
3. Claude scans every symbol in your watchlist, reads your indicator values, applies your `rules.json` criteria, and prints:

```
BTCUSD  | BIAS: Bearish  | KEY LEVEL: 94,200  | WATCH: RSI crossing 50 on 4H
ETHUSD  | BIAS: Neutral  | KEY LEVEL: 3,180   | WATCH: Ribbon direction on daily
SOLUSD  | BIAS: Bullish  | KEY LEVEL: 178.50  | WATCH: Hold above 20 EMA

Overall: Cautious session. BTC leading bearish, SOL the exception — watch for divergence.
```

4. Save it: *"save this brief"* (uses `session_save`)
5. Next morning, compare: *"get yesterday's session"* (uses `session_get`)

---

## How Claude Knows Which Tool to Use

Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically when working in this project. It contains the full decision tree.

| You say... | Claude uses... |
|------------|---------------|
| "Run my morning brief" | `morning_brief` → apply rules → `session_save` |
| "What was my bias yesterday?" | `session_get` |
| "What's on my chart?" | `chart_get_state` → `data_get_study_values` → `quote_get` |
| "Give me a full analysis" | `quote_get` → `data_get_study_values` → `data_get_pine_lines` → `data_get_pine_labels` → `capture_screenshot` |
| "Switch to BTCUSD daily" | `chart_set_symbol` → `chart_set_timeframe` |
| "Write a Pine Script for..." | `pine_set_source` → `pine_smart_compile` → `pine_get_errors` |
| "Start replay at March 1st" | `replay_start` → `replay_step` → `replay_trade` |
| "Set up a 4-chart grid" | `pane_set_layout` → `pane_set_symbol` |
| "Draw a level at 94200" | `draw_shape` (horizontal_line) |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `cdp_connected: false` | TradingView isn't running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`. Use the launch script. |
| `ECONNREFUSED` | TradingView isn't running or port 9222 is blocked |
| MCP server not showing in Claude Code | Check `~/.claude/.mcp.json` syntax, restart Claude Code |
| `tv` command not found | Run `npm link` from the project directory |
| `morning_brief` — "No rules.json found" | Run `cp rules.example.json rules.json` and fill it in |
| `morning_brief` — watchlist empty | Add symbols to the `watchlist` array in `rules.json` |
| Tools return stale data | TradingView still loading — wait a few seconds |
| Pine Editor tools fail | Open Pine Editor panel first: `ui_open_panel pine-editor open` |

---

## Architecture

```
Claude Code  ←→  MCP Server (stdio)  ←→  CDP (port 9222)  ←→  TradingView Desktop (Electron)
```

- **78 original tools** + **3 morning brief tools** = 81 MCP tools total
- **Transport**: MCP over stdio + CLI (`tv` command)
- **Connection**: Chrome DevTools Protocol on localhost:9222
- **No external network calls** — everything runs locally
- **Zero extra dependencies** beyond the original
